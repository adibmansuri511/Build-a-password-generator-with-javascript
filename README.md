# Build-a-password-generator-with-javascript
 We are going to build a simple yet customizable Random Password Generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is up to us when we need to include a combination of letters, numbers, as well as symbols, or any one of them.  In order to prevent unauthorized access, we sometimes need a strong password for our accounts on different websites. It is easy to determine an easy password that has more often only letters. A strong password is always one with a combination of letters, symbols, and numbers.
